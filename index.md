# Hiï¼Œwelcome to my website!

## About:
  Howdy! I'm Haoyu Han, an undergraduate student from Beijing Institute of Technology. I'm majoring in Computer Science, while also interested in Economics.

  I speak fluent Python, C/C++. When I'm not battling bugs, you can find me sipping on a cup of coffee while contemplating the meaning of 'null'.

## Skills:
  - Programming Sorcery
  - Bug Creation
  - Firewall Master
  - Keyboard Performance
  - Stay Up Extremely Late
  - Infinite Loop Escaping

## Fun Fact:
  Did you know? My code is so efficient that it once calculated the meaning of life in just 42 lines.

### Feel free to email me for chatting or whatever~
### Of course, chatting with GPT is much more funny than me....
